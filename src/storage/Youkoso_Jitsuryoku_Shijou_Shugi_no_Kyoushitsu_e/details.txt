Description: Receiving funding from the government to nurture the next generation&#039;s hopefuls, Koudo Ikusei High School brings together the brightest youth of Japan onto a single campus. At this seemingly perfect institution, the reserved Kiyotaka Ayanokouji arrives as an incoming member of class 1-D, where he befriends one of his classmates, the antisocial Suzune Horikita.
