Description: Takashi Natsume is a 15-year-old boy who wants nothing more but to live a normal life like everyone else. But to his dismay, like his deceased grandmother, Reiko, he possesses the ability to see &ldquo;youkai,&rdquo; or spirits. Natsume eventually discovers that Reiko had bequeathed to him a book of contracts in which she had bound youkai&mdash;the &ldquo;Book of Friends.&rdquo; However, without Reiko ever calling upon the spirits&rsquo; names, they have been left in a confined state. Now, these spirits continuously pursue Natsume in the hopes of having their contracts dissolved for freedom.
