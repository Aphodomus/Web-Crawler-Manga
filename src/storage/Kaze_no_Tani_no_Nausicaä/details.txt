Description: Humanity, once a technologically advanced and thriving civilization, has been pushed to the brink of extinction following a cataclysmic war known as the &quot;Seven Days of Fire.&quot; The remnants of the human race now live in scattered kingdoms to avoid the unrelenting spread of the &quot;Sea of Corruption,&quot; a colossal forest infested with dangerous mutant insects and fungi that produce poisonous spores.
