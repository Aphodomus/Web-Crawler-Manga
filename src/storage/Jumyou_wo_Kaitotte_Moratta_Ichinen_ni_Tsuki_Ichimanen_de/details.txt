Description: Helpless and struggling for cash, 20-year-old Kusunoki sells the last of his possessions to buy food. Noticing his poverty, an old shop owner directs him to a store that supposedly purchases lifespan, time, and health. While not completely believing the man&#039;s words, Kusunoki nevertheless finds himself at the address out of desperation and curiosity.
