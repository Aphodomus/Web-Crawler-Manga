Description: Ten years ago, &quot;the Gate&quot; appeared and connected the real world with the realm of magic and monsters. To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as &quot;Hunters.&quot; Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the &quot;World&#039;s Weakest,&quot; owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother&#039;s medical bills.
